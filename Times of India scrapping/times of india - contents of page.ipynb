      "The Kangana-Hrithik spat has divided social media into two camps. Fans of both Kangana and Hrithik are now doing all they can to extend support to their preferred star.  Just like Kangana's sister Rangoli posted an old pic of Hrithik and Kangana as a proof of their relationship, Hrithik fans too are going berserk sharing their own photos with junior Roshan to claim they also had an affair with him. With hashtag #HadAffairWithHrithik, fans are now trolling Kangana by taking a dig at Rangoli's so called evidence.  Here are some of the most viral tweets from this hashtag:   I had 10 yrs of relationship with @iHrithik and I only have this picture to prove @Rangoli_A ü§£ü§£ü§£ pic.twitter.com/JXJCg1VZ3L ‚Äî Nidhi Chaudhary (@thenidhii) October 6, 2017   I had 17yrs of relationship with @iHrithik I think this pic is enough to prove na üòú@DeepikaBhardwaj pic.twitter.com/9aVgFPQa0W ‚Äî SALONI (@iSaloniiSingh) October 7, 2017  However not just ordinary people, Hrithik had a lot of affairs with celebs and other high profile people.
